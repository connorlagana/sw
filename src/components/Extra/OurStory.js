              Suburban Wave was born in 2019 in Avon-by-the-Sea, New Jersey. Two
              college friends realized that the cubicle life wasnâ€™t for them so
              they quit their corporate day jobs. Following the rules that
              someone else made up no longer made sense. Instead of settling for
              a good life, they decided to go against the grain to pursue a
              great one. So, at the beginning of the largest financial crisis
              ever, they risked everything to start a company. A company that
              would allow them to ignore the rules, have fun and not take
              themselves too seriously. That spirit lives on today, as Suburban
              Wave has grown into a global brand with a unique combination of
              positivity and humor; and a commitment to always re-imagine the
              good life.
