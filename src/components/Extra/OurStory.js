              Suburban Wave was born in 2019 in Avon-by-the-Sea, New Jersey. Two
              college friends realized that the cubicle life wasnâ€™t for them so
              they quit their corporate day jobs. Following the rules that
              someone else made up no longer made sense. Instead of settling for
              a good life, they decided to go against the grain to pursue a
              great one.

              So, at the beginning of the largest financial crisis and global
              pandemic ever, they risked everything to start a company. A
              company that would allow them to ignore the rules, have fun and
              not take themselves too seriously. That spirit lives on today, as
              Suburban Wave has grown into a global brand with a unique
              combination of positivity and humor; and a commitment to always
              re-imagine the good life.
